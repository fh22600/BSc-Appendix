This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for the analysis of D-NEMD simulations of Kemp eliminase variants 1A53-2 and 1A53-2.5.
'miniforge3' was used for the installation of the python package manager miniconda, used to create the python environments to use Jupyter notebooks and execute python scripts. 

Please note that filepaths used in analysis notebooks may need changing as extra directories needed to be made in order to commit data and code to GitHub.
